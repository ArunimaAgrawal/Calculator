# Calculator
First Project using HTML and CSS

This is my first calculator forthe start of my series of projects. I will be uploading my series of projescts here.
This calculator has basic features of addition, substraction, multiplication and division. Later will try to add more elements
in it and make it more complex so that it can perform multiple tasks which can be done ins scientific calculator too.
